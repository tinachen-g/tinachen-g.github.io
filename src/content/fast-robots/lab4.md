## Prelab

### Dual Motors
Diagram with your intended connections between the motor drivers, Artemis, and battery (with specific pin numbers)

### Battery 

Battery discussion

The Artemis will be powered by the first battery and the motor drivers & motors are powered by the second battery. 


## Lab Tasks
Picture of your setup with power supply and oscilloscope hookup
Power supply setting discussion
